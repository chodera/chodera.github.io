A little Shiny app that visualizes [data from INSEE](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2521169#consulter){:target="_blank"} (the national statistics bureau of France) on communities in Alsace. This app was implemented in order to play around with [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} and to test its functionalities. Note that there is some missing data for a few units due to boundary changes.
