The project [Chronik flüchtlingsfeindlicher Vorfälle](https://www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de/service/chronik-vorfaelle) (*engl. Chronicle of refugee incidents*) documents attacks on and demonstrations against refugees and refugee shelters in Germany. It is based on publicly accessible reports in newspaper articles, police press releases and reports from counselling centres for victims of right-wing, racist and anti-Semitic violence.
